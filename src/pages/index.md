  I've worked as a Technical Assistant, ATD, FXTD in ILM Singapore. I was a
  Computer Science graduate but I was a pretty bad college student, I got to be
  honest. Only at work did I exclaim how lucky I was to be able to program stuff
  and safe myself painful hours of mundane work.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
